This is a clone of Netflix website built using React.JS as a Front-end & Firebase as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page and movie player.

Firebase Google Authentication.
